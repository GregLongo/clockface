# Accordion

Accordions allow you to capture a lot of content with the option to take up limited space with the expand/collapse pattern of the component.
Accordions add friction to discovering detailed content (since users have to click it open), so usecases would be for when users won't need to read through everything.

### Usage

```tsx
import {Accordion} from '@influxdata/clockface'
;<Accordion>
  <Accordion.AccordionHeader>{headerItem}</Accordion.AccordionHeader>
  <Accordion.AccordionBodyItem>{bodyItem1}</Accordion.AccordionBodyItem>
  <Accordion.AccordionBodyItem>{bodyItem2}</Accordion.AccordionBodyItem>
</Accordion>
```

##### Ref Type

```tsx
import {AccordionRef} from '@influxdata/clockface'
```

### Example

<!-- STORY -->

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->

<!-- PROPS -->
