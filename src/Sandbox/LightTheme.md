# Light Theme

This sandbox tests how different components behave when set to "light theme". Light theme is managed by a component called `ThemeProvider` that passes a context to its children. Children can optionally make use of the context and not every component has a light theme (yet).

### Example

<!-- STORY -->

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->
